# Open Brain

Open Brain is a local-first capture, provenance, review, and knowledge pipeline. It is being built as the single public implementation that will replace two private predecessor codebases after behavioral parity and a controlled production cutover.

The Phase 3 source-checkout boundary is one single-user local appliance rooted at one private Brain directory. One daemon owns mutation authority, internal scheduling, and the authenticated local HTTP/UI surface. Engine tasks supply capture, inbox/spaces, review, retrieval, reconciliation, backup, and Portable Brain operations. Private deployment configuration, live service state, migration evidence, and cutover receipts remain outside this repository.

## Principles

- Preserve the owner's one-line reason for saving something as first-class provenance.
- Route intent through a closed enum: `reference`, `idea`, `action_candidate`, or `hold`.
- Require review before third-party content can become an owner-authored idea or action.
- Default unknown or personal content to local-only handling.
- Keep private content, credentials, host configuration, and runtime state outside the repository.
- Maintain one canonical application repository rather than public and private forks.

## Development

Requirements: Python 3.14 and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

### macOS v0 installation

The v0 release supports macOS 14 or newer on Apple Silicon through a versioned source checkout
or the published `open-brain` and `open-brain-engine` wheels. A native macOS DMG and Apple
notarization are deferred to a later release and do not block v0. No package or release artifact
has been published yet. Follow [the macOS installation guide](docs/install-macos.md) for both paths.

### Run the local single-user slice

Set one Brain root. The command creates the private runtime layout with owner-only
permissions and reuses its stable local identity on later runs.

```bash
export OPEN_BRAIN_ROOT="$HOME/open-brain-data"
uv run open-brain init --json
```

Start the source-checkout daemon in one terminal:

```bash
uv run open-brain daemon
```

Then use the owner CLI from another terminal:

```bash
uv run open-brain spaces create "Projects" --delivery=setup-projects --json
uv run open-brain capture quick text "Review the roadmap" --delivery=capture-roadmap --json
uv run open-brain inbox list --json
uv run open-brain query roadmap --json
```

Canonical text capture requires the `space_id` returned by `spaces create`, because Portable Brain
canonical-page frontmatter always carries a stable space identity:

```bash
uv run open-brain capture canonical text "Project context" \
  --delivery=capture-project-context \
  --space=space_REPLACE_WITH_RETURNED_ID \
  --json
```

Every mutating command requires a caller-supplied delivery ID. Repeating the same request
with the same delivery ID returns the existing identifiers. Reusing a delivery ID for a
different request fails closed and records metadata-only quarantine evidence.

### Verify the repository

```bash
uv sync --group dev
uv run open-brain --version
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy
uv run pytest -q
uv run python -m build
```

Release auditing requires a local, uncommitted private denylist:

```bash
PRIVATE_DENYLIST=/path/to/private-denylist.txt make audit
```

The denylist contains one private term per line. Blank lines and lines beginning with `#` are ignored. Release mode refuses to pass without it.

## Status

The Phase 3 source-checkout appliance supports one local Brain root, stable portable identities,
typed capture, spaces, inbox routing, sibling review proposals, terminal decisions, canonical
Markdown publication, direct-edit reconciliation, lexical retrieval, immutable backup, disposable
restore, and distinct Portable export/import. The CLI, authenticated HTTP/share boundary, local UI,
scoped MCP, and public-job sinks use bounded capabilities over the same engine task objects. With
no model configured, captures remain usable and report `pending_enrichment`.

This is pre-alpha software. Phase 2 implements engine-level Portable Brain validation, export,
clean-root import, and disposable index rebuild. Export and import preserve portable identities,
history, routing, and exact source bytes while excluding operational state such as credentials,
databases, leases, runtime files, and indexes. The default profile uses provider `none` and
loads no connectors. A retained synthetic `JOB-029` proof exercises the internal seam only with
an absolute private configuration reference, capture-only authority, and egress enabled; host
evidence binds accepted captures to checkpoint advancement.

The public result projection exposes opaque IDs, bounded provenance, and safe titles/excerpts,
not raw or encoded protected references, absolute paths, credentials, storage-derived slugs and
paths, or bare SHA-256 tokens.
Phase 3 also defines source-checkout upgrade, rollback, and data-preserving uninstall through an
injected artifact lifecycle port, with launchd/systemd adapter evidence on Linux and macOS CI. The
default source-checkout effect remains unavailable. P4-W5 adds an unpublished frozen composition
with a manifest-bound native adapter, active-daemon quiescence, rollback restoration, and confined
managed cleanup. The native build reads an isolated archive of the named Git tree, rejects
replacement refs and external attributes, and compares every extracted blob and mode with the raw
no-replace tree. It admits only tracked package resources and records the source-tree digest.
Launchd upgrades unload the KeepAlive job before offline work and bootstrap it again afterward.
The current v0 release scope uses source/wheel installation on macOS and a checksummed native
archive on Linux. Native macOS DMG distribution is deferred to a later release. Publishing remains
a separate owner-authorized step.
Predecessor modules remain retained legacy compatibility code and are excluded from the default
application path.
