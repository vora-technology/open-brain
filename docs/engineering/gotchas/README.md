# Gotcha registry

Non-obvious behaviors, sharp edges, and lessons learned belong here.

## Registry

### PRIVACY-001: A redaction receipt does not authorize a sink

Symptom: Redacted content appears safe but still carries a `secret`, `unknown`, classification-failure, explicit-local-only, or unconfirmed `personal` privacy decision.

Cause: Redaction and authorization answer different questions. A receipt records a transformation; it does not widen the original privacy authority.

Fix: Have every work-tier event or Markdown adapter enforce the immutable privacy decision before any I/O.

Discovered: 2026-08-13.

### REVIEW-001: Approval evidence must be bound to one review

Symptom: A valid approval event can be paired with another review or approved-intent record during deserialization.

Cause: The event shape was validated without checking its review ID and deterministic approved record against the enclosing review.

Fix: Reject mismatched review IDs and approved records at the model boundary.

Discovered: 2026-08-13.

### STORAGE-001: SQLite paths are root capabilities

Symptom: A database path under the configured root escapes through a symlink, or SQLite sidecar files receive permissive default modes.

Cause: Lexical path checks and default SQLite file creation do not enforce filesystem containment or private permissions.

Fix: Traverse parents without following symlinks and maintain database, WAL, and SHM files at `0600`.

Discovered: 2026-08-13.

### CAPTURE-001: Private raw storage preserves canonical bytes

Symptom: Persisting a capture changes its deterministic capture ID.

Cause: Redaction was applied to identity-bearing raw fields before private persistence.

Fix: Store canonical raw captures unchanged. Apply redaction only when producing typed work-tier records.

Discovered: 2026-08-13.

### INDEX-001: Excluded symlinks must not block canonical indexing

Symptom: An index rebuild fails even though a retained source symlink is explicitly outside
the indexed content policy.

Cause: Traversal rejected the presence of every symlink instead of excluding links without
following them.

Fix: Ignore source symlinks before file classification, never follow file or directory targets,
and regression-test that target content is absent from the index.

Discovered: 2026-08-19.

### RELEASE-001: Assemble detector canaries at runtime

Symptom: The release audit flags a test fixture that resembles a real credential assignment.

Cause: Secret scanners correctly inspect committed test text without knowing whether a value is synthetic.

Fix: Build detector canaries from harmless fragments at runtime instead of committing assignment-shaped literals.

Discovered: 2026-08-13.

### CAPTURE-002: Resume from a durable event after a crash

Symptom: A retry after event persistence fetches mutable source content again and creates a second event with different bytes.

Cause: Recovery restarted the full extraction pipeline instead of checking the event stream first.

Fix: If one matching durable extraction event exists, rebuild only the deterministic distillation item and continue from that boundary.

Discovered: 2026-08-13.

### CAPTURE-003: Extracted metadata does not always repeat the source URL

Symptom: A provenance-bound YouTube capture retries forever during saved-content
publication because its normalized extraction has a platform and video ID but no canonical
URL.

Cause: Publication required `metadata.canonical_url` even though some approved extractors
represent source identity through typed platform fields.

Fix: Require the immutable envelope URL to match its provenance source reference, prefer an
extracted canonical URL when present, and otherwise use the provenance-bound envelope URL.

Discovered: 2026-08-26.

### SECURITY-001: A closed gate must be unreachable

Symptom: Documentation says an executor or redactor is unavailable, but callers can inject any implementation through a public constructor.

Cause: Policy checks were mistaken for runtime confinement or approved-policy selection.

Fix: Reject arbitrary injection until a concrete adapter passes its gate; use one policy-version-locked redactor for work-tier events.

Discovered: 2026-08-13.

### MEDIA-001: Resource limits must be enforceable

Symptom: A command object lists timeout, memory, or process limits that the runtime never applies.

Cause: Descriptive metadata was treated as execution enforcement.

Fix: Apply operating-system limits, process-group cleanup, output bounds, and staging checks. Return `tool_unavailable` on unsupported platforms.

Discovered: 2026-08-13.

### PROVIDER-001: Cloud authority does not prove prompt safety

Symptom: A cloud-authorized privacy decision allows secret-shaped prompt text to reach adapter construction or credential resolution.

Cause: Routing authority and content redaction were treated as the same gate.

Fix: Scan the final cloud prompt before factory construction. A finding returns a closed code with zero factory, credential, import, or provider calls.

Discovered: 2026-08-13.

### LEDGER-001: Frozen dataclasses are not trusted constructors

Symptom: A caller directly constructs a sanitized leaf or trusted citation and injects Markdown structure or traversal into output.

Cause: Merge code checked the Python type but not the value's invariants.

Fix: Validate during construction and again at every merge, render, apply, and synthesis boundary.

Discovered: 2026-08-13.

### LEDGER-002: Two sink writes need one visibility decision

Symptom: A crash after the first Markdown write exposes half of a ledger publication.

Cause: Individual atomic files were mistaken for an atomic document set.

Fix: Readers use only the durable applied manifest that binds every intended document and sink digest. Reconciliation completes partial physical writes before publishing the manifest.

Discovered: 2026-08-13.

### LEDGER-003: Slim authorization comes from durable state

Symptom: Caller-provided booleans or citation tuples authorize archive/slim without a persisted applied ledger row.

Cause: Evidence was passed as mutable orchestration input instead of loaded from the store.

Fix: Use a store-issued row identity, verify persisted citations, and atomically record archive digest, successor digest, and `slimmed` after both writes verify.

Discovered: 2026-08-13.

### LEDGER-004: A writer cannot certify its own persistence

Symptom: A no-op or memory-only writer returns plausible IDs, digests, and cached read-back bytes, causing durable state to advance although no artifact exists.

Cause: Apply trusted caller-provided receipt fields or allowed the same adapter to attest both the write and its persistence.

Fix: Validate receipt type, disposition, ID, and deterministic rendered-byte digest, then read exact bytes through a separate approved root-confined reader before the manifest or slim state advances.

Discovered: 2026-08-13.

### LEDGER-005: A model lock guard cannot be optional

Symptom: Constructing synthesis with no lock probes invokes a model without proving transaction and writer locks are clear.

Cause: A safety invariant was represented as an optional callback tuple.

Fix: Reject construction without an authoritative probe and fail closed when a probe errors or reports a held lock.

Discovered: 2026-08-13.

### REVIEW-002: Review audit text is not owner output

Symptom: Third-party instructions in a source reference or proposal reason survive approval and appear in an owner-authored record.

Cause: Delivery copied audit fields instead of deriving an output-safe reference.

Fix: Render owner text plus a deterministic opaque capture reference only, then verify the sink receipt before marking the outbox delivered.

Discovered: 2026-08-13.

### REVIEW-003: Review creation receipts bind the initial aggregate

Symptom: Intent routing reports an open review after a no-op boundary returns the right review ID with unrelated bytes.

Cause: Routing checked identity and disposition but not the canonical aggregate digest.

Fix: Hash `ReviewAggregate.create(proposal)` canonically and require the creation receipt to match before returning `review_open`.

Discovered: 2026-08-13.

### SYNTHESIS-001: Citation authority includes destination and durable proof

Symptom: A persisted citation ID is paired with a forged destination, or a memory-only persistence port returns synthesis success.

Cause: Authority compared IDs only and accepted an unconstrained persistence result.

Fix: Recompute the deterministic destination from the published capture document and require the approved SQLite store to return and confirm an exact typed durable record.

Discovered: 2026-08-13.

### TAXONOMY-001: Printable labels only

Symptom: NEL or Unicode line/paragraph separators create extra structure inside a rendered topic heading.

Cause: Label validation rejected ASCII controls but not all non-printable Unicode characters.

Fix: Reject non-printable characters and Markdown structural punctuation before route construction.

Discovered: 2026-08-13.

### CLI-001: Dependency injection is not output authority

Symptom: A typed adapter returns success while echoing argv through a command value or dynamic JSON key, asserting reserved readiness fields, or pairing a failure status with exit zero.

Cause: The composition root trusted the adapter's result type without independently validating its public schema and process semantics.

Fix: Use closed command and schema-key allow-lists, scan converged encoded keys and values against argv and secret/path residuals, reserve live/parity/cutover fields for a separate evidence boundary, and enforce status/exit coherence.

Discovered: 2026-08-14.

### AUDIT-001: Unclassifiable runtime references are unsafe

Symptom: An old-source path passes audit because the deny-root set is empty or a path-bearing argument uses an unsupported representation.

Cause: No extracted path was treated as proof that no path existed.

Fix: Require a non-empty deny policy and reject executable, working-directory, referenced-file, or argument values that cannot be completely classified into the canonical path representation.

Discovered: 2026-08-14.

### HOOK-001: Path strings do not grant hook-install authority

Symptom: A manual hook installer can target a replaced, symlinked, or different repository after planning.

Cause: Installation authority was represented by caller-provided paths instead of a bound filesystem identity.

Fix: Bind an explicit capability to repository, Git, and hooks-directory identities; revalidate before descriptor-relative writes; keep dry-run as default; and make post-commit delivery bounded and fail-zero.

Discovered: 2026-08-14.

### MIGRATE-001: Atomic files do not make an atomic state generation

Symptom: A crash after the first migrated state file leaves readers with a partial seven-family target that cannot safely resume.

Cause: Per-file atomic replacement was mistaken for one visible migration commit.

Fix: Stage and verify a complete generation off-path, hold an identity-bound exclusive lease, publish one atomic `CURRENT` pointer as the reader-visible commit, and use a durable journal to recover pre- and post-pointer crashes.

Discovered: 2026-08-14.

### PORTABLE-001: UTC partitions come from persisted recording time

Symptom: A record near a month boundary is written under different partitions on hosts with
different local time zones or after a retry.

Cause: Partitioning used the process wall-clock month instead of the immutable acceptance or
recording timestamp stored with the record.

Fix: Normalize the persisted timestamp to UTC before deriving `YYYY/MM`. Occurrence-time
corrections append a superseding row; they do not move the original record.

Discovered: 2026-08-31.

### ARCHITECTURE-002: Package entry points are runtime dependency edges

Symptom: Static imports report zero architecture debt while the installed command imports a
legacy composition module before selecting the current app path.

Cause: Ownership checks classified Python files but did not verify the targets in package script
metadata.

Fix: Point default scripts directly at app-owned entrypoints and test their imports in a fresh
process. Keep predecessor and scheduled behavior behind an explicit legacy facade.

Discovered: 2026-08-31.

### PRIVACY-002: Encoded residue must be compared after bounded decoding

Symptom: A protected source reference is removed in raw form but survives in percent-encoded or
HTML-entity form, or a query term is echoed by a result explanation.

Cause: Projection compared only the stored literal and renderers treated encoded output as
unrelated text.

Fix: Apply bounded repeated percent/HTML decoding when checking public tokens, fail closed when
decoding does not converge, protect exact digests, and keep query explanations generic.

Discovered: 2026-08-31.

### CLI-002: Prefix flags must survive family dispatch

Symptom: `--dry-run` before a command family is discarded, or the process creates a Brain root
and operational state before the adapter rejects the request.

Cause: The process shell opened application composition before handling the global non-mutating
flag, then passed only arguments after the family name to the adapter.

Fix: Reject unsupported global dry-run requests before opening the application. Direct adapter
dispatch still receives non-representation prefix flags, and the process regression must prove
the requested root was never created.

Discovered: 2026-08-31.

### PRIVACY-003: A hash of private input is not an opaque ID

Symptom: A metadata-only result omits the query text but returns a deterministic digest or digest
prefix derived from it.

Cause: A content hash was treated as an identifier even though callers can verify guesses against
private input.

Fix: Generate retrieval IDs independently with a cryptographic random source, return them only as
opaque correlation values, and scan public results for full and truncated query digests.

Discovered: 2026-08-31.

### CLI-003: Root-free operations normalize representation flags first

Symptom: `--version` works without configuration, but adding `--json` before or after it opens
the application and fails for a missing Brain root.

Cause: Root-free detection compared the raw argument tuple instead of removing the
representation-owned output flag.

Fix: Validate duplicate flags, remove `--json` before recognizing help/version, and test each
supported ordering without runtime configuration.

Discovered: 2026-08-31.

### PRIVACY-004: Case-insensitive values have many reversible digests

Symptom: A protected URL is removed regardless of case, but the SHA-256 of a case-varied spelling
still appears in a public result.

Cause: The projection knew the canonical value's digest but could not enumerate every
case-equivalent preimage digest.

Fix: Treat standalone SHA-256-shaped output tokens as private residue. Use prefixed opaque record
IDs for public correlation instead of publishing bare content hashes.

Discovered: 2026-08-31.

### PORTABLE-002: Promote the exact validated snapshot

Symptom: Validation succeeds, but the bytes materialized or promoted during import/export differ
from the bytes that were checked.

Cause: The operation validated a pathname and read it again after another process or filesystem
transition changed the content.

Fix: Retain one immutable validated snapshot, materialize and verify that snapshot, then perform
the identity-bound atomic promotion. Retry evidence must bind to the same manifest and snapshot.

Discovered: 2026-08-31.

### CONNECTOR-001: Host evidence owns connector checkpoints

Symptom: A connector reports successful fetches or checkpoint advancement that do not match the
captures durably accepted by the Brain.

Cause: Connector-mutated counters or receipt claims were treated as authoritative at the host
boundary.

Fix: Meter discovery, fetch, extraction, and submission at host-owned capabilities. Record the
exact sink receipt with its delivery ID and source reference, and advance the checkpoint only when
that evidence matches the host receipt.

Discovered: 2026-08-31.

### ARCHITECTURE-001: Line-numbered debt is a live coordinate

Symptom: An import-debt report points to the wrong source line after a nearby edit, making a
violation appear fixed or assigning it to the wrong code.

Cause: Debt entries stored line numbers from an earlier source snapshot.

Fix: Regenerate line-numbered debt from the current source tree after every source edit and verify
the reported edge before accepting the classification or marking the debt resolved.

Discovered: 2026-08-31.

### INGRESS-001: Rejected pages must not starve later eligible rows

Symptom: A rejected first row keeps the cursor pinned forever, so later eligible input is never
processed; advancing the whole page can instead lose retry evidence when an eligible sink write
fails.

Cause: Cursor advancement treated a mixed page as all-or-nothing and did not distinguish policy
rejection from durable sink failure.

Fix: Advance past policy-rejected rows, but retain the cursor at the eligible row when its sink
submission fails. Keep bounded retry evidence for both outcomes.

Discovered: 2026-08-31.

### MCP-001: Scope retrieval before capability injection

Symptom: MCP tool calls enforce a space allow-list, but the adapter's stored retrieval attribute
still exposes unrestricted search or fetch to other callers.

Cause: The app injected the full retrieval task and asked the representation to derive a scope for
each tool call.

Fix: Derive the scoped retrieval capability at composition, inject only that capability, and reject
objects that still expose the unrestricted `scoped` factory.

Discovered: 2026-09-01.

### INTEGRATION-001: Installed optional modules are not necessarily preloaded

Symptom: An explicitly enabled optional integration reports `optional_dependency` even though its
module is installed and importable.

Cause: Availability checked `sys.modules`, which describes prior import state rather than installed
module availability.

Fix: At the reviewed app extension host, import the composition-declared module only after its
capability is enabled. Keep disabled/default profiles import-free.

Discovered: 2026-09-01.

### BACKUP-001: Replay-identical backups cannot include mutable scheduler state

Symptom: Replaying one backup request produces different app-state bytes even though the
canonical Brain content did not change.

Cause: The backup included scheduler cursors and claims that can advance while the request is
being verified or replayed.

Fix: Back up only schema-validated immutable run receipts. Recreate scheduler runtime state after
restore instead of treating it as recoverable instance data.

Discovered: 2026-09-01.

### BACKUP-002: An allow-listed backup path does not validate its contents

Symptom: A known app-state filename enters a backup with arbitrary JSON or credential-shaped
content.

Cause: Inventory validation treated the relative path as authority for every byte stored there.

Fix: Give each allowed app-state artifact an exact bounded schema, reject extra fields, and scan
validated values for forbidden residue before publishing the manifest.

Discovered: 2026-09-01.

### LIFECYCLE-001: A pending journal does not prove that its owner crashed

Symptom: A concurrent lifecycle request sees a pending upgrade and rolls back work that another
process is still performing.

Cause: Durable intent records survive crashes, but they do not carry live process authority.

Fix: Hold a distinct root-scoped kernel lease for the full lifecycle attempt. Recover a pending
record only after acquiring that lease, and bind each staged effect and terminal receipt to the
same request fingerprint.

Discovered: 2026-09-01.

### LIFECYCLE-002: A daemon cannot safely coordinate its own replacement

Symptom: Upgrade or uninstall restarts or removes the daemon unit before the coordinator can
record success, failure, or rollback evidence.

Cause: The lifecycle coordinator runs inside the process and supervisor unit that it is replacing.

Fix: Run lifecycle orchestration from a short-lived owner command outside the daemon, inject the
artifact and supervisor ports, and keep the default source-checkout composition fail closed.

Discovered: 2026-09-01.

### AUDIT-002: Cleaning the current tree does not clean reachable history

Symptom: The source tree is clean, but the public-history audit still reports an older planning
path or synthetic private-network fixture.

Cause: Replacing the current file leaves every earlier blob reachable, while broad path or rule
exceptions would hide unrelated future residue.

Fix: Sanitize the current tree and record only reviewed historical false positives by exact blob
SHA-256, normalized repository path, and allow-listable rule. Never permit credential or private
denylist findings through that policy.

Discovered: 2026-09-01.

### CI-001: Short Unix-socket test roots must exist on every supported host

Symptom: Daemon, UI, recovery, and subprocess tests pass on macOS but fail before setup on every
Linux CI version.

Cause: Tests shortened Unix-socket paths by creating temporary roots below macOS-specific
`/private/tmp`, which is absent on Linux.

Fix: Resolve `/tmp` before creating deliberately short temporary roots. It becomes canonical
`/private/tmp` on macOS and remains `/tmp` on Linux, preserving both path identity and host
portability. Treat the full multi-version Linux jobs as required evidence.

Discovered: 2026-09-01.

### CONTROL-001: Default Unix-socket backlog behavior varies by host

Symptom: A partial client occupies the serial daemon reader and the next owner request gets
`EAGAIN` on Linux, while the same stalled-client regression passes on macOS.

Cause: Calling `listen()` without an explicit backlog left queue capacity to platform defaults.
The accepted-client timeout bounded the first read but did not guarantee that the next connection
could queue.

Fix: Set an explicit bounded backlog larger than one and keep the accepted-client timeout. Assert
the backlog in the stalled-client regression instead of adding sleeps or client-side retries.

Discovered: 2026-09-01.

### PACKAGING-001: A moved regular subpackage hides unmoved workspace modules

Symptom: Root tests cannot import legacy or connector modules even though both source roots are on
`PYTHONPATH`.

Cause: A moved `open_brain.cli`, `open_brain.integrations`, or `open_brain.services` initializer
creates a regular package whose search path excludes the still-classified directory under
`src/open_brain`.

Fix: Extend those search paths only in the root test harness while the phased move is incomplete.
Never add workspace path extension to the shipping app. The wheel-only harness must remain green,
and P4-W4 removes the test overlay with the old monolith tree.

Discovered: 2026-09-01.

### TOOLING-001: Ruff cache can hide import reclassification after package moves

Symptom: Local Ruff verification passes after moving modules between source roots, but a clean CI
checkout reports many `I001` import-order failures.

Cause: Cached lint results predate the relocation even though isort's first-party classification
depends on the module's source root and distribution boundary.

Fix: Configure `open_brain` as first-party and `open_brain_engine` as its third-party dependency.
Run Ruff once with `--no-cache` after package moves and treat that result as the migration gate.

Discovered: 2026-09-01.

### PACKAGING-002: Module depth does not prove a source checkout

Symptom: An installed supervisor manifest contains a nonexistent `PYTHONPATH` and working
directory below the interpreter's library directory.

Cause: The factory counted parents above `__file__`. Source and installed modules have similar
depth, so a `site-packages` path was mistaken for a checkout.

Fix: Enable source mode only when the module resolves to the exact declared source layout. Exercise
the production factory from the installed wheel, not only constructors with `checkout_root=None`.

Discovered: 2026-09-01.

### TESTING-001: An inner fixed interpreter can falsify a CI version matrix

Symptom: Python 3.13 and 3.14 jobs pass even though their wheel-isolation subprocesses run on
Python 3.12.

Cause: The outer matrix selected an interpreter, but the acceptance harness hard-coded another
version when creating product and test environments.

Fix: Derive isolation environments from the active matrix interpreter. Run the installed journey
independently on every declared Python version.

Discovered: 2026-09-01.

### AUDIT-003: ImportFrom.module alone misses private child and lazy dependencies

Symptom: An artifact scan accepts a private engine child imported through a public parent, or an
undeclared dependency loaded only on a lazy path.

Cause: The scanner recorded only the parent in `from package import child` and inspected only
engine-prefixed static imports.

Fix: Resolve aliases against the complete manifest module map, compare external roots with wheel
metadata, reject forbidden workspace roots, and allow-list each variable dynamic import by exact
artifact path and signature.

Discovered: 2026-09-01.

### AUDIT-004: Callable spelling does not establish dynamic-import provenance

Symptom: An artifact scan misses imports reached through `builtins`, assignment aliases, or
reflective lookup, while rejecting an unrelated local object whose name happens to be `importlib`.

Cause: The scanner trusts global names instead of following bindings from actual importer
capabilities. An allow-listed call signature also leaves untracked capability escapes in the same
file.

Fix: Track importer bindings and calls through lexical provenance. Treat every capability use as a
review event, and bind the sole exception to its exact artifact path and function signature.

Discovered: 2026-09-02.

### AUDIT-005: Importer provenance also flows through runtime namespaces

Symptom: Direct and aliased dynamic-import checks pass, but an artifact can still reach the same
importer through `sys.modules["builtins"]`, namespace helpers, or dynamic evaluation.

Cause: Python exposes built-in objects through module registries and namespace dictionaries. A
scanner that follows only import statements and local aliases loses that provenance.

Fix: Treat `sys.modules`, `globals`, `locals`, `vars`, `eval`, and `exec` as reviewed artifact
capabilities. Reject them by default and keep the one authorized dynamic import bound to its exact
file and function.

Discovered: 2026-09-02.

### AUDIT-006: AST walk order is not control-flow provenance

Symptom: A dead-branch assignment erases a real importer path, while a loop, context-manager, or
exception target is mistaken for the standard-library module it shadows.

Cause: One mutable binding map follows AST visitation order. It neither joins alternate outcomes
nor applies Python's lexical and compound-target binding rules.

Fix: Track sets of possible provenance, join control-flow outcomes, predeclare function-local
names, and model loop, `with`, exception, match, and comprehension scopes before inspecting uses.

Discovered: 2026-09-02.

### AUDIT-007: Import aliases and comprehension walrus targets share existing authorities

Symptom: Attribute-based reflection is rejected, but importing that same member with
`from ... import ...` passes; or a walrus target disappears when a comprehension scope exits.

Cause: The analyzer maintains separate syntax-specific member rules and treats every name inside a
comprehension as comprehension-local. Python resolves imported members through the module object,
while PEP 572 binds assignment-expression targets in the enclosing scope.

Fix: Use one module-member provenance function for attribute and `ImportFrom` syntax. Keep
iteration targets local to the comprehension, but propagate walrus targets to the nearest enclosing
scope and predeclare them as function locals.

Discovered: 2026-09-02.

### AUDIT-008: A reviewed name does not prove a reviewed dynamic-import value

Symptom: An artifact passes because a dynamic loader and argument retain approved spellings, even
though an equivalent module alias reaches the loader or the argument was reassigned first.

Cause: The analyzer keys exceptions to syntax instead of semantic authority and value provenance.
Python also exposes import state through package `__init__` modules, `pkgutil`, frames, and type
reflection.

Fix: Normalize equivalent authorities, distinguish pristine parameters from unknown or reassigned
values through control-flow joins, and reject internal package roots again at the runtime optional
loader boundary.

Discovered: 2026-09-02.

### AUDIT-009: Architecture gates should close authority, not simulate a sandbox

Symptom: Each review finds another Python spelling that reaches the same generic loader, and the
acceptance analyzer grows without producing a finite security boundary.

Cause: P4H009 is treated as malicious-code containment even though its contract is to catch app
architecture regressions. The generic string loader keeps the unwanted authority open.

Fix: Replace arbitrary module strings with a closed typed provider registry, reject internal
identifiers at runtime, and review the gate against a named finite adversarial corpus.

Discovered: 2026-09-02.

### AUDIT-010: Source projections must not erase stale review evidence

Symptom: A removed exception remains in the canonical review inventory, but the normal
architecture gate passes after the reviewed file moves to another source root.

Cause: A helper filters both source records and their review entries before stale-review
validation. The evidence disappears from the test instead of becoming stale.

Fix: Validate the canonical review inventory against current source locations, including moved
records. Keep legacy source projections limited to the code or debt they were created to select.

Discovered: 2026-09-02.

### CONNECTOR-002: A `python -m` protocol module creates a second type identity

Symptom: A valid worker request reaches the child, but the connector rejects it because exact type
checks see a different `ConnectorWorkerRequest` class.

Cause: Running the protocol module with `python -m` defines its classes under `__main__`. The
connector imports the canonical module name and receives a second set of class objects.

Fix: Execute a small child bootstrap module that imports and invokes the canonical protocol module.
Keep all request, receipt, and error types defined only under the canonical module name.

Discovered: 2026-09-02.

### CONNECTOR-003: A valid child receipt does not prove host-budget compliance

Symptom: A connector worker returns schema-valid metadata with counts above the parent-issued
budget, or claims that replay created another capture.

Cause: Receipt validation checked field types and local count relationships without binding both
runs to the request limits or the replay contract.

Fix: Revalidate each run against the exact parent budget. Require replay to submit no captures and
bind the reported capture count to the created receipts before accepting worker output.

Discovered: 2026-09-02.

### RELEASE-002: Artifact coordinates and manifest labels must use the same number

Symptom: Connector wheels and sdists build, but artifact policy reports a stale rewrite or empty
canonical membership.

Cause: The policy coordinate `connectors` generated `connectors-wheel` and `connectors-sdist`, while
the canonical manifest uses singular `connector-wheel` and `connector-sdist` dispositions.

Fix: Name the policy coordinate `connector`. Keep the distribution directory and Python package
names independently plural where their published identities require it.

Discovered: 2026-09-02.
