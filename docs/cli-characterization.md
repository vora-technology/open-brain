# Public CLI characterization

This document records the retained Phase 0 parser and scheduled-route boundary. Phase 2 moved the
installed CLI, HTTP, and MCP scripts to a six-family app-owned entrypoint; the 31-family parser
below remains legacy compatibility evidence. The packaging subsection follows current metadata.

The machine-readable source is [`tests/fixtures/phase0/public_cli.json`](../tests/fixtures/phase0/public_cli.json). The focused characterization test compares that fixture with the live parser registry, scheduled route registry, static `pyproject.toml` metadata, and stable exit-code constants.

## Parser surface

The retained parser exposes 31 top-level command families:

`backup`, `capture`, `close-day`, `config`, `cron`, `curation`, `dev`, `digest`, `doctor`, `explain`, `hooks`, `inbox`, `index`, `ledger`, `lifeos`, `lint`, `messages`, `migrate`, `now`, `okf`, `ops`, `proposals`, `query`, `registry`, `retention`, `review`, `share`, `social`, `spaces`, `status`, and `ui`.

The global parser options are `--version`, `--json`, `--dry-run`, `-h`, and `--help`. Help is inspected without loading configuration or creating content or state roots. `--version` prints `open-brain 0.1.0` and exits `0`; the focused test checks the output and exit code without loading application state.

The parser exposes families that are also used by scheduled routes. A parser-visible family is not evidence that every delegated subcommand grammar is implemented at the dispatcher boundary. In particular, the current characterization does not freeze command-specific help output.

The legacy `migrate` family remains parser-visible for compatibility, but default application composition deliberately does not register a `migrate` adapter. In the default route it returns the bounded `unavailable` failure envelope; predecessor-only `parity`, `shadow`, and `doctor --cutover` routes are not parser-reachable and are rejected as usage errors.

## Scheduled routes

The fixture records 30 scheduled routes, keyed by `JOB-001` through `JOB-030`. Each route records its parser path, literal options, and typed adapter family (`capture`, `writer`, or `optional`). Options are recorded as parser metadata, including configured-value placeholders already present in the static job catalog. No configuration values are read.

Several routes share a parser path and are distinguished by their options and job ID. This includes the `backup run`, `capture serve`, `doctor`, `index`, and `now check` families. The fixture preserves those distinctions.

| Job | Parser path | Options | Adapter |
|---|---|---|---|
| `JOB-001` | `doctor` | `--json --role=probe` | optional |
| `JOB-002` | `index` | `--check --json --read-only` | optional |

| `JOB-026` | `ui serve` | `--bind=CONFIGURED_PRIVATE_BIND --port=CONFIGURED_PORT` | optional |
| `JOB-027` | `capture serve` | `--bind=CONFIGURED_PRIVATE_BIND --port=CONFIGURED_PORT` | capture |
| `JOB-028` | `capture serve` | `--bind=CONFIGURED_PRIVATE_BIND --mode=ingress --port=CONFIGURED_PORT` | capture |

| `JOB-030` | `now check` | `--json --read-only` | optional |

## Packaging and entry points

The static package metadata identifies distribution `open-brain`, version `0.1.0`, and these seven console entry points:

- `open-brain` → `open_brain.services.phase1_entrypoints:run_cli`
- `open-brain-youtube-bridge` → `open_brain.production.youtube_bridge:main`
- `open-brain-project-commit-queue` → `open_brain.production.project_commit_bridge:queue_main`
- `open-brain-project-commit-relay` → `open_brain.production.project_commit_bridge:relay_main`
- `open-brain-project-commit-bridge` → `open_brain.production.project_commit_bridge:bridge_main`
- `open-brain-http` → `open_brain.services.phase1_entrypoints:run_http`
- `open-brain-mcp` → `open_brain.services.phase1_entrypoints:run_mcp`

The test reads only the `[project]` and `[project.scripts]` tables from `pyproject.toml`. It does not inspect an installed environment, absolute paths, ignored files, or remote metadata.

## Stable exit classes

Interactive CLI classes are `0` success, `1` failure, `2` usage, and `3` deferred. Scheduled application classes are `0` success, `1` failure, `75` lock held, and `78` configuration failure. The bounded union recorded by Phase 0 is therefore `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `75`, and `78`.

These are exit classes, not a promise that every command currently reaches every class. The focused characterization test locks the numeric mapping to the current `ExitCode`, scheduled `ExitClass`, and scheduled dispatch contract.

## Deliberately absent Phase 1 surface

The current CLI does not expose the product-contract command families for initialization and lifecycle management, including `init`, upgrade, uninstall, or Portable Brain export/import. They are documented here as absent. Phase 0 does not implement them.

The same boundary applies to command-specific help snapshots and delegated `ledger`/`migrate` grammars: they remain concerns for later work rather than new Phase 0 behavior.
