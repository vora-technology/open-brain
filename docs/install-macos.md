# Install Open Brain on macOS

Open Brain v0 supports macOS 14 or newer on Apple Silicon with Python 3.14 and `uv`. You can run
the versioned source checkout or install the matching app and engine wheels. The DMG is deferred
to a later release.

No release tag or wheel has been published yet. The commands below define the v0 installation
path and work with locally built artifacts during pre-release verification.

## Option 1: versioned source

Clone the repository and select the release tag named in the release notes:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vora-technology/open-brain.git
cd open-brain
git checkout <release-tag>
uv sync --frozen --package open-brain --no-dev
```

Choose one private Brain directory and initialize it:

```bash
export OPEN_BRAIN_ROOT="$HOME/open-brain-data"
uv run --frozen --package open-brain --no-dev open-brain init --json
```

Start the daemon in the foreground:

```bash
uv run --frozen --package open-brain --no-dev open-brain daemon
```

Keep that terminal open. Press `Control-C` to stop the daemon.

## Option 2: wheels

Place the matching app and engine wheels from one release in the same directory. Install them into
an isolated uv tool environment without contacting a package index:

```bash
uv tool install --offline --no-python-downloads --python 3.14 \
  --with ./open_brain_engine-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl \
  ./open_brain-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
export PATH="$(uv tool dir --bin):$PATH"
```

Initialize the Brain and start the daemon:

```bash
export OPEN_BRAIN_ROOT="$HOME/open-brain-data"
open-brain init --json
open-brain daemon
```

## Confirm the installation

Open another terminal, set the same root, and inspect the running service:

```bash
export OPEN_BRAIN_ROOT="$HOME/open-brain-data"
open-brain --version
open-brain status --json
open-brain spaces create "Projects" --delivery=setup-projects --json
open-brain capture quick text "Review the roadmap" --delivery=capture-roadmap --json
open-brain query roadmap --json
```

The default provider is `none`, cloud access is off, and the HTTP service binds to loopback. The
Brain root contains the generated local credential and user data; keep it private.
