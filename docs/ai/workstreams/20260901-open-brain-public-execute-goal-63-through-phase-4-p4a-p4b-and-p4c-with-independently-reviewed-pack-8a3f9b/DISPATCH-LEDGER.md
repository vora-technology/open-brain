Shared package metadata, the move manifest, imports, root lockfile, shared

## Child 1: P4-W0 read-only implementation map

- Status: complete
- Agent ID: `01a05f60-5e5d-7392-8a75-a5e983948511`
- Model: `gpt-5.4`
- Reasoning effort: `high`
- Role: read-only exploration
- Write scope: none
- Source scope: public Open Brain repository only
- Prompt: `P4-W0-RESEARCH-PROMPT.md`
- Required output: current mechanism map, proposed schema/invariants, harness
  seams, exact file list, ranked risks, and READY/NEEDS_DECISION
- Result: `READY`; P0/P1/P2 `0/2/2`. Both P1 findings are accepted into
  P4-W0: widen release-audit paths and place `tools/phase4` under strict MyPy.
