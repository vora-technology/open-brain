# Phase 4 execution evidence

## Gate 0 launch

- Explicit user launch received on 2026-09-01.
- Runtime goal registered for Goal #63.
- Fresh fetch confirmed `origin/main` at
  `3b89a4ba4787a378e6040ff042bd117da881918d`.
- Exact reviewed plan SHA-256 confirmed as
  `7fe6e5d1e48b44fb4fba232661a8b01eeca019e4f35a43f1b2c162914905bfd2`.
- New branch `goal/open-brain-phase4` created from that base; reviewed planning
  commit cherry-picked as `68c34d723e8f0bbdc7a51d5c5070e63e994b335d`.
- New implementation workstream created; planning task IDs and state were not
  reused.
- Public required checks, current workflow hosts, open parent goals, local
  ARM64/Python/uv/signing tools, project gotchas, and latest private Goal #24
  handoff were inspected.
- No runtime source moved, no native artifact built, and no production or live
  Brain state was accessed during launch.

## Gate 0 baseline verification

- `make verify`: passed Ruff, strict MyPy on 474 source files, all 3,114 tests,
  isolated wheel/sdist builds, and artifact policy.
- Current source-ownership validator: 53 tests passed.
- Source plus wheel/sdist release audit: passed with one untracked synthetic
  denylist.
- Reachable-history audit: passed with the same denylist.
- Explicit artifact-policy rerun and `git diff --check`: passed.
- Inventory equality: all 224 tracked runtime Python files exactly match the
  canonical classification; owner counts are engine 46, app 34, connector 5,
  legacy 135, and workspace 4; temporary live debt is zero.
- Additional manifest subjects observed: 250 tracked Python files under
  `tests/` and 36 tracked schema/fixture files.
- Required public checks: strict linear `main`, `verify (3.12)`, `verify
  (3.13)`, `verify (3.14)`, and `public-artifacts`; force pushes and branch
  deletion disabled.
- Successful CI logs directly identify macOS 14 ARM64 and Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64
  builders.
- Local build host: ARM64, Python 3.12, `uv`, `notarytool`, and one valid
  Developer ID Application identity. A ready notary credential profile was not
  found on either checked authorized host.
- Private read-only preflight: exact scoped helper and host identity checks
  passed; arbitrary sudo and root SSH remained denied; service, writer,
  synchronization, executable-reference, and recovery-readiness inventories
  completed with zero mutations and no private output in this repository.
- Private recovery access is not currently ready and must be remediated and
  re-proved before P4-W8. The prior Goal #24 apply remains historical and will
  not be rerun.
- Launch status comments:
  `cbolden15/agent-config#63` comment `5502133708`, parent `#41` comment
  `5502134010`, and parent `#24` comment `5502134267`.

## P4-W0 local candidate

- Canonical schema: version 3 with Phase 4 schema version 1.
- Subject closure: 224 runtime plus 331 non-runtime equals 555 exact current
  subjects. Non-runtime kinds: 253 tests, 21 package resources, 21 fixtures,
  15 schemas, 10 release tools, 4 release resources, 3 generated reports, 3
  entry points, and 1 test resource.
- Generated evidence: exact move report, exact import-rewrite report, and one
  11-finding current-monolith expected-red report.
- Expected-red execution: exited 1 and exactly matched the committed bounded
  finding set (`P4E001` through `P4E005`). It is not a required green test.
- `make phase4-contracts`: 68 tests passed; Ruff passed; strict MyPy passed on
  481 source files; canonical validator returned zero findings.
- `make verify`: 3,129 tests passed; Ruff and strict MyPy passed; isolated
  wheel/sdist builds used Hatchling 1.32.0; artifact policy passed.
- Source plus built-artifact release audit, reachable-history audit, explicit
  artifact-policy rerun, Gitleaks over 51 commits, `uv lock --check`, and
  `git diff --check`: passed.
- Runtime movement assertion: no path below `src/open_brain` changed relative
  to the reviewed launch commit.
- Read-only child 1 implementation map: `READY`, P0/P1/P2 `0/2/2`. Both P1s
  were implemented: Phase 4 tools are under strict MyPy and public-artifact
  triggers cover the new manifest/tools/tests.
- Checkpoint commit: `ae144db9e461f9e369976c04b75467eb5c69a144`.
- Draft PR: `vora-technology/open-brain#6`.
- Exact-commit PR checks passed: protected `phase4-contracts`, `verify (3.12)`,
  `verify (3.13)`, `verify (3.14)`, `public-artifacts`, macOS ARM64 appliance
  lifecycle, CodeQL Actions analysis, and CodeQL Python analysis.
- Branch protection now requires `phase4-contracts` in addition to the prior
  four required checks.
- Sanitized Goal #63 checkpoint comment: `5502376856`.
- P4-W0 is complete. P4-W1 may begin; later gates remain blocked by their own
  source, artifact, review, recovery, and production preconditions.

## P4-W1 source checkpoint

- Workspace and engine movement completed in commits `c884d88`, `5f127c1`, and
  `2174dc2`. The four-member workspace is active, all 46 engine runtime files
  and Portable resources are moved, and the app/connector/legacy skeletons
  remain nonbuildable for their later waves.
- Remote Python 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14 jobs failed only because the source-checkout
  restart test waited for a changed Unix socket inode. Linux immediately reused
  that inode. Commit `4ab916d27dacdccefdf1619120d3b323da5dc707` now waits for
  a bounded status control-protocol response. Twenty consecutive local restart
  cycles passed, followed by all exact-head PR checks.
- Fresh read-only review of `4ab916d27dacdccefdf1619120d3b323da5dc707`
  returned `NOT_READY`, P0/P1/P2 `0/0/4`. The valid repository findings were:
  incomplete manifest-declared artifact membership, no execution of the moved
  engine tests from the installed wheel, and stale P4-W1 evidence. The fourth
  finding corrected the review packet from a nonexistent manifest path to
  `docs/v0-package-classification.json`; no second manifest was created.
- Red regressions proved the gaps: the acceptance test could not import an
  installed engine-test command, and artifact tests failed for absent manifest
  binding, accepted unclassified members, and incomplete derived membership.
- Source checkpoint `a82485dd699ca7cd56c86d1904da7487fa1f87c1` fixes all
  three repository findings. Exact artifact membership is derived from the
  canonical manifest. PEP 639 license files and declared release resources are
  packaged, and a bounded Hatch hook removes forced VCS exclusion-file residue
  from the sdist.
- The isolated engine gate now installs only the engine wheel into its product
  environment and executes all 20 moved engine test modules through a separate
  locked test-runner environment. Tests run from copied inputs with repository
  source and the app, connector, and legacy distributions unavailable.
- Exact-head CI at `974631e21e0a71a97b7269c69757e268687a5a63` failed only
  the installed-engine contract in `phase4-contracts` and Python 3.12, 3.13,
  and 3.14 verification. A clean Linux reproduction showed uv's default wheel
  install had hardlinked packaged Portable fixtures to its cache, so their
  link count correctly violated the unique-regular-file invariant.
- Commit `181f9ae3438955d23dd39a155b7f23e9b93aa2f6` makes the
  isolated product install use uv's copy mode. All 11 focused harness and
  engine-distribution tests passed in a metadata-free Linux Python 3.12
  container; no validator invariant was weakened.
- Candidate `7266e494f431ac84d9635b1a044bd15ce303c731` is pushed and
  clean. Exact-head CI run `33584116919`, public-artifacts run `33584116923`,
  and CodeQL run `33584115528` passed, including Phase 4 contracts and Python
  3.12, 3.13, and 3.14 verification.
- Fresh read-only child 4 reviewed all nine P4-W1 commits and 371 changed paths
  at `7266e494`. It returned `NOT_READY`, P0/P1/P2 `0/0/1`. Exact artifact
  membership, execution of all moved tests under wheel isolation, and the sole
  canonical manifest path are independently resolved. The only finding was
  stale completion evidence in STATE, EVIDENCE, HANDOFF, and the dispatch
  ledger; this bounded evidence-only update repairs that finding.
- Local Python 3.12 and uv 0.12.8 verification passed: 76 Phase 4 contracts,
  Ruff, strict MyPy on 485 files, manifest validation, 3,139 total tests,
  wheel/sdist build, exact artifact policy, source plus artifact release audit,
  reachable-history audit, Gitleaks over 59 commits, `uv lock --check`, and
  `git diff --check`.
- Artifact SHA-256 digests:
  wheel `83e534799359e8ccb7ac8e90dfd5114564c0638428c5f50ca897a26f495cc682`;
  sdist `d62df80976117ff76ccbbb3a753b8765e7cb9f3c2404b273ef27e3a18e418c26`.
- Evidence successor `aab6f1e0891d551a87a2968ef9fb0dae1a8e62e2` passed all
  exact-head checks. Its fresh rereview returned `READY`, P0/P1/P2 `0/0/0`;
  P4-W1 is complete.
- No publication, deployment, production, private-state, or cutover action
  occurred.

## P4-W2 complete

- Behavior repair `2f08a48aefe51eb755885d9f9ae01cf9c5fa5769` packages the
  launchd/systemd templates and adds an installed supervisor mode. Its red
  regression failed exactly for absent resources and rejected installed mode;
  the repaired supervisor suite passed before movement.
- Implementation checkpoint `2ed82c05ad2f5508a9a04b3c7eadeb86ed676cdf`
  moves all 34 app runtime files, 28 existing app test modules, and app
  resources to `packages/app`; adds one explicit two-test wheel gate module;
  and binds the installed CLI/MCP scripts.
- Canonical inventory is 224 runtime plus 348 non-runtime subjects. It includes
  257 test subjects, 34 moved app runtime records, and 38 moved app subjects.
- App metadata requires exactly `open-brain-engine==0.1.0`; wheel metadata,
  module origins, console scripts, supervisor resources, and connector/legacy
  absence are asserted from an installed product environment.
- A static wheel scan derives the allowed public engine modules from the
  canonical manifest and rejects app imports of private engine modules.
- The isolated app contract builds with `--no-sources`, installs only copied
  app/engine wheels into Python 3.12, and exposes that site-packages directory
  to a separate locked test runner. All 400 app tests pass without checkout
  fixtures, connector, legacy, or workspace source.
- Named wheel-only contracts pass `V0-GATE-07` with six sibling proposals and
  independent CLI/UI approve, reject, and safe edit. They pass `V0-GATE-13`
  with space create/rename, later route without capture-identity change, and
  scoped/all-space retrieval through CLI and UI.
- Artifact policy version 2 owns app and engine distribution/kind coordinates.
  The real app/engine wheels and sdists contain exactly canonical members and
  no forbidden or undeclared members.
- Candidate `85428b125ddd370cfa6a6c2be20f2aab4669bf7e` passed exact-head CI after
  one same-SHA retry. CI attempt 1 failed only the Python 3.12 app-isolation
  wrapper with generic `P4H007`; the concurrent dedicated Ubuntu/Python 3.12
  contract and a local isolated Python 3.12 full suite passed. Attempt 2
  passed every job.
- Child 6 reviewed `85428b1` and returned `NOT_READY`, P0/P1/P2 `0/3/1`.
  The P1 findings were installed supervisor source leakage, false-positive
  3.13/3.14 wheel coverage, and incomplete private/undeclared import checks.
  The P2 was this stale evidence packet.
- Three focused regressions reproduced all P1 findings before repair:
  installed factory rendering leaked `PYTHONPATH`; environment creation
  selected 3.12 while the active interpreter was 3.14; and the artifact scan
  missed private-child, undeclared, and unreviewed dynamic imports.
- Repair checkpoint `7d87c3968e15de5d98f7e509c8c8a31c4c5b500c` validates a
  source-checkout layout before adding supervisor paths, selects the active
  matrix interpreter, derives the complete engine module policy and declared
  app dependencies, allow-lists one exact dynamic import seam, and reports
  bounded app-isolation failure stages.
- Local verification passed: `make verify` (Ruff, strict MyPy on 488 files,
  3,148 tests, and all four artifact builds/policy); a separate uncached Ruff
  run; `make phase4-contracts` (79 tests, Ruff, MyPy, manifest); app-wheel
  journeys under isolated Python 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14; source+artifact release audit;
  reachable-history audit; Gitleaks 8.30.1 over 66 commits; `uv lock --check`;
  and `git diff --check`.
- Exact-head CI run `33591952670`, public-artifacts run `33591952648`, and
  CodeQL run `33591951436` passed at `7d87c39`, including interpreter-specific
  wheel execution on Python 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14.
- Artifact SHA-256 digests:
  app wheel `9b0f06e03e2bdfcfc690e011faa15773eb4efbf26844fff5c446bfc0d11ad84d`;
  app sdist `d6afc82e2cc3ec4d9bf53215129c39a64542a60cbe7831b95505b2660208917a`;
  engine wheel `83e534799359e8ccb7ac8e90dfd5114564c0638428c5f50ca897a26f495cc682`;
  engine sdist `a52e659e44d4dcfc882f76d998540a41d2abffa7886a83db365cb688c914084a`.
- Evidence checkpoint `579b45bc12247d34ed612798fc2a6021ccc1d30a`
  passed all exact-head checks before the second P4-W2 review.
- Child 7 reviewed `579b45b` and returned `NOT_READY`, P0/P1/P2 `0/1/0`.
  The sole P1 found dynamic-import bypasses through `builtins`, assignment
  aliases, and reflective access, plus a false positive for a local object
  named `importlib`.
- A focused artifact regression failed before repair on every reported case.
  Self-review extended it with an importer-capability escape inside the sole
  reviewed dynamic-import file.
- Repair checkpoint `e27ac3c3ad7daa4748b094490fdadab6e66a3773`
  follows lexical provenance for dynamic importer capabilities, records
  constant targets for private and undeclared dependency checks, rejects
  unresolved uses, and binds the only exception to its exact artifact path
  and function signature.
- Final local verification passed: `make verify` (Ruff, strict MyPy on 488
  files, 3,149 tests, and all four artifact builds/policy); uncached Ruff;
  `make phase4-contracts` (80 tests, Ruff, MyPy, manifest); isolated
  app-wheel journeys on Python 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14; source+artifact release
  audit; reachable-history audit; Gitleaks 8.30.1 over 69 commits; `uv lock
  --check`; and `git diff --check`.
- Exact-head CI run `33594652359`, public-artifacts run `33594652371`, and
  CodeQL run `33594650509` passed at `e27ac3c`, including interpreter-specific
  wheel execution on Python 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14.
- Rebuilt artifact SHA-256 digests were unchanged from the preceding repair.
- Evidence checkpoint `0a67a26210b79d0c91fa8953846560db34903034`
  passed all exact-head checks before the third P4-W2 review.
- Child 8 reviewed `0a67a26` and returned `NOT_READY`, P0/P1/P2 `0/1/1`.
  The P1 reproduced a private engine import through
  `sys.modules["builtins"]` and identified the same fail-open class through
  runtime namespace helpers. The P2 found that the isolated app evidence said
  402 tests although the exact package scope collects 400.
- A focused artifact regression failed before repair for `sys.modules`,
  `globals`, `locals`, `vars`, `eval`, `exec`, and an assigned alias. Its
  negative case proved a shadowed local `globals` callable remains clean.
- Repair checkpoint `d8e2cb20f0268e16ebdd5b46053d5081dab7ac7c`
  carries provenance through `sys.modules` and built-in namespace mappings,
  fails closed on dynamic evaluation capabilities, records constant private
  and forbidden targets, and corrects both app-suite claims to 400.
- Latest local verification passed: `make verify` (Ruff, strict MyPy on 488
  files, 3,150 tests, and all four artifact builds/policy); uncached Ruff;
  `make phase4-contracts` (81 tests, Ruff, MyPy, manifest); exact collection
  of 400 app tests; isolated app-wheel journeys on Python 3.12, 3.13, and
  3.14; source+artifact release audit; reachable-history audit; Gitleaks
  8.30.1 over 71 commits; `uv lock --check`; and `git diff --check`.
- Exact-head CI run `33596668616`, public-artifacts run `33596668630`, and
  CodeQL run `33596666546` passed at `d8e2cb2`, including interpreter-specific
  wheel execution on Python 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14.
- Rebuilt artifact SHA-256 digests remained unchanged.
- Evidence checkpoint `e483973e7f8153b97aa5a44b049d787d08fd884f`
  passed all exact-head checks before the fourth P4-W2 review.
- Child 9 reviewed `e483973` and returned `NOT_READY`, P0/P1/P2 `0/1/0`.
  The P1 reproduced import escapes through `sys.__dict__`,
  `sys.__getattribute__`, and function or lambda `__globals__`. It also found
  path-insensitive rebinding and false positives where loop, `with`, or
  exception targets shadowed the standard-library `sys` module.
- One focused artifact regression failed before repair on every positive and
  negative case, including a hidden `__globals__` import in the otherwise
  reviewed optional-provider file. Self-review added bound function and
  `object.__getattribute__` variants before broad verification.
- Repair checkpoint `bd994a0288f8711f216e130c25c45f7a654eb90f`
  uses conservative provenance sets, joins branch states, models function,
  class, loop, `with`, exception, match, and comprehension bindings, and
  recognizes namespace and bound `__getattribute__` reflection.
- Current local verification passed: `make verify` (Ruff, strict MyPy on 488
  files, 3,151 tests, and all four artifact builds/policy); uncached Ruff;
  `make phase4-contracts` (82 tests, Ruff, MyPy, manifest); all 11 analyzer
  tests independently on Python 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14; isolated app-wheel
  journeys on all three versions; source+artifact release audit;
  reachable-history audit; Gitleaks 8.30.1 over 73 commits; `uv lock --check`;
  and `git diff --check`.
- Exact-head CI run `33600292963`, public-artifacts run `33600292877`, and
  CodeQL run `33600287985` passed at `bd994a0`, including interpreter-specific
  wheel execution on Python 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14.
- Rebuilt artifact SHA-256 digests remained unchanged.
- Evidence checkpoint `0cff2ea6077b2450febd07f456310aff1f6ffd25`
  passed all exact-head checks before the fifth P4-W2 review.
- Child 10 reviewed `0cff2ea` and returned `NOT_READY`, P0/P1/P2 `0/2/0`.
  One P1 reproduced forbidden imports through aliases of `sys.__dict__`,
  `sys.__getattribute__`, and `builtins.object`. The other reproduced a PEP
  572 comprehension assignment that lost its enclosing-scope provenance.
- Focused wheel regressions failed before repair for each positive path and
  for the related shadow-negative case. Self-review added symmetric
  `importlib` and `builtins` aliases plus normal walrus overwrite behavior.
- Repair checkpoint `e103255b2ab03c3312206383b71ce38fcde67b8e`
  derives `ImportFrom` bindings from the same modeled module-member authority
  used for attribute access. Comprehension assignment expressions now update
  their nearest enclosing scope and are predeclared as function locals.
- Latest local verification passed: `make verify` (Ruff, strict MyPy on 488
  files, 3,151 tests, and all four artifact builds/policy); uncached Ruff;
  `make phase4-contracts` (82 tests, Ruff, MyPy, manifest); all 14 analyzer and
  app-wheel tests on Python 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14; source+artifact release
  audit; reachable-history audit; Gitleaks 8.30.1 over 75 commits; `uv lock
  --check`; and `git diff --check`.
- Exact-head CI run `33602946392`, public-artifacts run `33602946514`, and
  CodeQL run `33602944303` passed at `e103255`, including interpreter-specific
  wheel execution on Python 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14.
- Rebuilt artifact SHA-256 digests remained unchanged.
- Evidence checkpoint `995bd781869901e772eee0c7fdfd0ab8132065d5`
  passed CI run `33603709388`, public-artifacts run `33603709475`, and CodeQL
  run `33603706129` before the sixth P4-W2 review.
- Child 11 reviewed `995bd78` and returned `NOT_READY`, P0/P1/P2 `0/2/0`.
  One P1 reproduced unreviewed imports through `importlib.__init__`,
  `pkgutil.resolve_name`, aliased `importlib.util`, `sys._getframe`, and
  function-type reflection. The other showed that the reviewed helper could
  reassign `import_path` while retaining its approved call spelling.
- Both focused artifact regressions failed with zero findings before repair.
  Self-review added `from` aliases, colon-qualified resolver targets,
  `function.__class__`, direct and conditional replacement, and
  second-parameter substitution. Four app tests prove internal roots are
  rejected by metadata construction and the runtime loader.
- Repair checkpoint `559690e14b9a1dd935566b54e97ec8f2b73f8d06`
  normalizes equivalent module authorities, tracks frame and type reflection,
  separates pristine parameters from unknown values through control flow,
  preserves the app's safe importlib resource/metadata APIs, and blocks
  internal package roots at the optional-provider boundary.
- Latest local verification passed: `make verify` (Ruff, strict MyPy on 488
  files, 3,157 tests, and all four artifact builds/policy); uncached Ruff;
  `make phase4-contracts` (84 tests, Ruff, MyPy, manifest); exact collection
  of 404 app tests; all 16 analyzer and app-wheel tests on Python 3.12, 3.13,
  and 3.14; source+artifact release audit; reachable-history audit; Gitleaks
  8.30.1 over 77 commits; `uv lock --check`; and `git diff --check`.
- Exact-head CI run `33608085686`, public-artifacts run `33608085774`, and
  CodeQL run `33608082590` passed at `559690e`, including interpreter-specific

  passed CI run `33609157287`, public-artifacts run `33609157406`, and CodeQL
  run `33609152877`. Child 12 started a final review and was stopped without a
  verdict after the candidate architecture was superseded.
- Repair checkpoint `9ca31ba36c44e4e4a269e5c932fae27fa174831e`
  removes the generic string-based loader and its sole P4H009 exception. A
  closed `OptionalProvider` enum selects an immutable lazy-loader registry
  containing only the declared `openai` extra. Typed construction makes
  internal roots unrepresentable, while the runtime loader rejects non-enum
  internal identifiers. P4H009 remains a finite adversarial architecture
  corpus rather than a malicious-code sandbox.
- Latest local verification passed: `make verify` (Ruff, strict MyPy on 488

  passed CI run `33611917553`, public-artifacts run `33611917534`, and CodeQL
  run `33611914545`. Its six changed files were docs-only, so child 12 resumed
  against unchanged source `9ca31ba` with `ee2f8c2` as the evidence scope.
- Child 12 returned `NOT_READY`, P0/P1/P2 `0/0/1`. The canonical manifest
  retained the removed optional-loader review at `integrations/ports.py:917`.
  A direct full-inventory reproduction reported the stale review, while the
  normal architecture test passed because `_planned_source_classification`
  removed reviews for moved source records before stale validation.
- Repair checkpoint `30d49d31d35f86e26be3c0ac99b884a47d76b5f6`
  removes the stale review and makes the normal architecture gate compare the
  canonical review inventory with all current `open_brain` source locations.
  A moved-source regression proves stale and unreviewed records remain visible;
  the legacy source projection no longer filters review evidence.
- Latest local verification passed: `make verify` (Ruff, strict MyPy on 488
  files, 3,158 tests, and all four artifact builds/policy); uncached Ruff;
  `make phase4-contracts` (85 tests, Ruff, MyPy, manifest); exact collection

## P4-W3 local source candidate

- Starting from verified P4-W2 closure
  `c3480be28fa36b9dae2256ff6aee610044b86847`, all five canonical
  connector-owned runtime files and three connector-owned tests moved to the
  buildable `open-brain-connectors` distribution. The canonical inventory now
  contains 232 runtime files and 355 Phase 4 subjects, including 260 tests; all
  nine connector runtime records are moved.
- The connector wheel depends on exact app and engine versions and imports app
  values only from the published provisional extension modules. The app wheel
  has no connector dependency, its default profile discovers none, and an
  installed connector remains unloaded in the parent before and after child
  execution.
- The worker request binds protocol version, invocation, entry-point metadata,
  manifest, budget, and network mode. The child runs with an empty environment,
  direct socket APIs disabled, bounded process/time/memory/output resources,
  metadata-only responses, and process-group termination. Parent validation
  binds receipts to identity, manifest, budget, capture count, and replay.
- Actual reference conformance runs the YouTube connector twice against
  synthetic host-mediated media and a durable temporary checkpoint. The first
  run creates one capture; replay creates none.
- Local verification passed: `make phase4-contracts` with 87 tests, Ruff,
  strict MyPy on 500 files, and manifest validation; `make verify` with 3,170
  tests and all six artifact builds/policy; connector wheel-only acceptance on
  Python 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14 with 3 tests per version; and `actionlint`.
- Source plus built-artifact release audit, reachable-history audit, Gitleaks
  8.30.1 over 83 commits, `uv lock --check`, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Rebuilt SHA-256 digests are app wheel

- The branch-finish gotcha audit added canonical module-identity,
  artifact-coordinate, and parent-budget receipt entries. No other
  non-duplicate finding survived the evidence and registry checks.
- First exact-head CI run `33627007197` at source `fe579e4` passed all three
  full verify jobs, Phase 4 contracts, and the macOS appliance job. Release
  audit run `33627007170` passed. The three new connector-isolation jobs failed
  during job setup because their copied `setup-uv` commit pin differed by one
  character from every existing job; no repository step ran. A focused
  regression now requires all four pins to be present and identical. The
  corrected workflow, regression, `actionlint`, `make phase4-contracts`, and
  `make verify` all pass locally.
- Repair checkpoint `2c05dead068ef517ed365d100f3b6273c29eeba9`
  passed exact-head CI run `33627525857`, Release audit run `33627525864`, and
  CodeQL run `33627520718`. The run includes green connector-isolation jobs on
  Python 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14, three full verify jobs, Phase 4 contracts, the
  macOS appliance suite, public artifacts, source/artifact and history audits,
  and Gitleaks. PR #6, its remote branch, and local HEAD matched the reviewed
  source; the draft PR was mergeable.
- Child 13 (`01a06202-4d7a-7331-a038-239a6e93a630`) reviewed source `2c05dea`
  and returned `NOT_READY`, P0/P1/P2 `0/1/0`. `P4W3-001` proved that the
  default in-process registry could resolve and execute the installed public
  connector entry point, bypassing the worker boundary.
- A direct regression failed on the reviewed design, then passed after the
  installed public group became metadata-only, injected compatibility retained
  a distinct internal group, and the published entry-point object lost its
  direct `run()` method. The wheel-only contract now proves both
  `ConnectorRegistry.resolve()` and `ConnectorHost.run()` leave the connector
  module unloaded in the parent. All 72 focused connector/composition tests,
  `make phase4-contracts` with 87 tests, and `make verify` with Ruff, strict
  MyPy on 500 files, 3,171 tests, six artifact builds, and artifact policy pass.
  The wheel-only connector journey passes on Python 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14.
- Source/artifact and reachable-history audits, Gitleaks 8.30.1 over 85 commits,
  actionlint, `uv lock --check`, and `git diff --check` pass for the repair.

  `33629754431`. All connector, full verify, Phase 4, macOS, artifact, and

- Child 13's same-lineage rereview returned `READY`, P0/P1/P2 `0/0/0`, at
  source `27344c6`. It reproduced the fresh-wheel parent non-load behavior,
  explicitly closed `P4W3-001`, found no new issues, and declared P4-W3 ready
  for milestone closure.
- P4-W3 is complete. P4-W4 has not started, and its reviewer budget resets at
  the next milestone boundary. No publication, tag, release, native build,
  deployment, production/private access, cutover action, or P4-W4 work occurred.
- No publication, tag, release, native build, deployment, production/private

## P4-W4 local repair candidate

- Governance launch commit `a94fed1` and behavior-neutral movement commit
  `818caf6` remain separate from this repair candidate. The canonical move put
  all 302 planned legacy and workspace paths at their final locations and
  removed the old `src/open_brain` tree.
- Initial post-move collection exposed 35 cross-namespace import errors. The
  deterministic rewriter now converts relative imports that cross a moved
  package boundary. The full root suite subsequently exposed and closed 11
  stale path, module-identity, and dynamic-module assertions.
- A source-derived dependency regression failed with an undeclared connector
  edge: legacy imported `{app, connectors, engine}` while the manifest and
  metadata declared only app and engine. The canonical graph, exact package
  metadata, lockfile, and wheel metadata now agree on all three inward edges.
- Focused architecture, manifest, package-build, app, engine, and legacy
  verification passed 233 tests. The complete repository suite passed 3,173
  tests in 69.89 seconds. `make phase4-contracts` passed 89 tests, Ruff,
  strict MyPy on 500 files, and manifest validation. `make verify` passed
  Ruff, strict MyPy, the same 3,173 tests, all six shipping artifact builds,
  and artifact policy.
- Source-free private legacy build hashes are wheel

  `199e0fc2adb264b0a0f9db50fd291e906b4d0a61cdb90e4eb55784716d000eca`.
- Uncached Ruff, strict MyPy, canonical manifest and import-rewrite checks,
  `uv lock --check`, and `git diff --check` pass.
- Repair checkpoint `678c61cab75f8b90ac64aa04ac8d06bac8ee220f`
  passed the focused source-free isolation matrix with 76 tests on each of
  Python 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14. Source plus all six shipping artifacts passed
  the release audit with an untracked synthetic denylist; reachable history
  passed with the same public-only fixture. Gitleaks 8.30.1 found no leaks
  across 90 commits, and actionlint passed.
- All local P4-W4 source, package, matrix, artifact, and audit gates are green.
  Exact-head CI run `33642529540`, Release audit `33642529483`, and CodeQL
  `33642524132` all passed at evidence commit
  `7927162096330355520f2de756aa45b48ccb6493`. Local, remote, and PR source
  identities match. The fresh independent review is now reserved as child 14;
  reviewer budget is one active and one total.
- Child 14 (`01a0628c-d723-73e0-96cc-f2b3d8ca3f63`) returned
  `NOT_READY`, P0/P1/P2 `0/1/1`, against exact source `7927162`.
  `P4A-001` proves D-040 broadened the approved engine-only legacy dependency
  into 42 app-importing files and eight connector-importing files, including
  distribution-private modules. `P4A-002` proves `CLAUDE.md` still names the
  deleted `src/open_brain/dev/artifact_policy.py` path. No other finding
  survived review. The same lineage is retained for rereview after both
  regressions and repairs pass exact-head CI.
- Both reviewer findings were reproduced before repair. The dependency
  regression observed `{app, connectors, engine}` instead of the approved
  `{engine}` graph, and the instruction regression found the deleted artifact
  policy path.
- The repaired legacy source has zero static app or connector imports. The
  canonical graph, validator, package metadata, lockfile, and private artifact
  metadata all declare only `open-brain-engine==0.1.0`. Thirty-four supporting
  modules are contained in the legacy-only `_compat` namespace and classified
  as private compatibility.
- A new clean-room contract builds engine and legacy with `--no-sources`,
  installs only those two wheels, imports every module in the legacy wheel, and
  proves the app and connector namespaces are unavailable. It passes, as do all
  2,147 legacy tests.
- The P4-W5 readiness preflight has seven passing tests. It invokes each of the
  six required read-only probes once, fails closed without propagating raw
  errors, emits only booleans and `rct_v1_` opaque receipts, validates restored
  snapshots, and reuses one snapshot through P4-W5, P4-W6, P4-W7, P4-W8, and
  P4-W9 without another probe call.
- Current local verification passes 98 Phase 4/architecture tests, Ruff,
  strict MyPy on 536 files, manifest validation, all 3,182 repository tests,
  six source-free shipping builds, artifact policy, `uv lock --check`, and
  `git diff --check`. Exact-commit audits and remote checks remain pending.
- Candidate `b86beacbc7005b0a7f2ceeb5c009f0a2849579a6` passed exact-head CI
  `33650699793`, Release audit `33650699895`, and CodeQL `33650693028`; every
  PR #6 job passed and local/remote source identities matched. Child 14's
  same-lineage rereview returned `NOT_READY`, P0/P1/P2 `0/1/1`. It explicitly
  closed `P4A-001` and `P4A-002`, then reported `P4A-003` for the sole external
  `_compat` import and `P4A-004` for uncaught `SystemExit` from a readiness
  probe.
- The new legacy wheel regression failed with `P4H009` on
  `_compat/open_brain/integrations/ports.py`. The readiness canary failed by
  propagating `SystemExit` and its synthetic sensitive detail. These were the
  expected red states before implementation.
- The repaired private compatibility metadata has no ambient provider loader.
  Its enabled path requires an injected callable; no callable returns the
  stable optional-dependency outcome. Wheel-level AST analysis rejects both
  static and dynamic import authority outside stdlib, engine, and legacy. The
  installed engine-plus-legacy-only contract imports every packaged module and
  exercises the enabled injected path without installing the OpenAI SDK.
- The readiness observer catches `SystemExit` alongside ordinary exceptions,
  fails closed, and derives the same opaque unavailable receipt without
  retaining exception text. `KeyboardInterrupt` is intentionally not caught.
  Both synthetic failure classes pass the boolean-and-receipt-only canary.
- Post-repair verification passed 10 focused tests; `make phase4-contracts`
  with 100 tests, Ruff, strict MyPy on 536 files, and manifest validation;
  `make verify` with Ruff, strict MyPy, 3,184 tests, six source-free shipping
  artifacts, and artifact policy; and 100 P4A tests on each of Python 3.12,
  3.13, and 3.14. Exact-commit audits and remote checks remain pending.
- At exact source `9098ff5e676a76ef1637f30dee99ff6508d46a30`,
  artifact policy, source plus six-shipping-artifact release audit,
  reachable-history audit with the same synthetic denylist, Gitleaks 8.30.1
  over 93 commits, actionlint, `uv lock --check`, manifest validation, `git
  diff --check`, and clean-tree verification passed.

  branch matched the exact reviewed source.
- Child 14's second same-lineage rereview returned `READY`, P0/P1/P2
  `0/0/0`. It independently reproduced the ten focused tests, found zero
  disallowed or unresolved `_compat` imports, verified `SystemExit` fails
  closed while `KeyboardInterrupt` remains effective, rebuilt the private
  artifacts with matching hashes, and explicitly closed `P4A-001` through
  `P4A-004` with no new finding.
- P4-W4 and P4A are complete. No private readiness implementation or state was
  accessed; only the public preflight contract was reviewed. No publication,
  tag, release, native build, deployment, production/private access, or
  cutover action occurred, and P4-W5 remains intentionally unstarted.

## P4-W5 implementation candidate

- Live grounding matched branch `goal/open-brain-phase4` at local, remote, and
  PR head `418fcd5530ee9a7fb2eaae6764d4f7ddffc46a97`. PR #6 remained open,
  draft, mergeable, and green on its inherited 12 checks. Goal #63 remained
  open. The worktree contained only the P4-W5 implementation described here.
- The one-shot snapshot SHA-256 remains
  `753a1635aa2be81f3ebe6b3723dbc8e46a6d6aa46f1b39003b9d9c39da769d1b`.
  Strict restore and exact serialization passed for P4-W5 through P4-W9. Its
  results remain signing true, macOS ARM64 true, disk true, Linux x86_64 false,
  notarization false, recovery false, and aggregate false. No readiness probe
  was called again.
- Static records explain Linux readiness without a probe: the inherited CI
  jobs used `ubuntu-latest`, while `release/phase4-toolchain.json` requires
  literal `ubuntu-24.04` for Linux x86_64. The new real native job uses that
  exact image. The macOS job uses GitHub's `macos-14` ARM64 YAML label, which
  resolves to the recorded `macos-14-arm64` image; the build also validates
  runtime architecture.
- Red-first checks rejected an unavailable native module, rejected
  `--artifact-kind=native-onedir`, found stale managed residue after uninstall,
  rejected Python-style frozen child commands, and found no real native CI
  subjects. Focused repairs passed 7 adapter and CLI contracts, 3 native
  entrypoint/worker contracts, 2 build/audit contracts, and the updated policy
  and CI contracts.
- One disposable, non-acceptance macOS diagnostic built with Python 3.12,
  PyInstaller 6.22.2, and hooks 2026.7. It audited 142 members, four confined
  symlinks, required supervisor resources, and tree digest
  `b862f373eb98977d5691b6e33949c670a467425e4292ee2b96ddbd1c594fb88b`.
  This digest is from uncommitted diagnostic source and cannot satisfy the
  frozen-candidate gate.
- Diagnostic smoke exposed and closed four harness/build defects: package
  relative imports from a PyInstaller entry script, noncanonical `/tmp` root
  identity, stale control-socket readiness on daemon restart, and an empty
  `PATH` hiding the required host supervisor. The passing strategy uses
  absolute package imports, a resolved root, successful control-response
  polling, and a temporary supervisor-only path containing no Python.
- The source candidate now includes a real manifest-bound native lifecycle
  adapter, direct frozen daemon and worker routing, a checked-in onedir spec,
  bounded build/member/runtime evidence, native activation and clean uninstall,
  the exact target-native jobs, and the single compositional preflight. The
  pinned dependency group is locked.
- Final `make p4w5-preflight` passed 91 focused tests, isolated pinned Python
  3.12 toolchain validation, actionlint, canonical manifest validation, Ruff,
  strict MyPy on 16 touched Python files, and `git diff --check`. Its earlier
  bounded failures exposed the invalid macOS image-name/YAML-label distinction,
  two Ruff findings, and four test-only MyPy attribute errors; each rerun
  followed a changed repair strategy. Source freeze, full verification, exact
  target-native evidence, and independent review remain pending.
- No signing, notarization, publication, release, deployment, service install,
  production/private-state access, recovery action, cutover, or P4-W6 work
  occurred.

## P4-W5 independent review repair candidate

- Exact-head CI `33667187568`, Release audit `33667187309`, and CodeQL
  `33667180599` passed at source
  `6c2c82de89b554cca8ec6c27b10a57959766c39e`. Child 15
  (`01a0636c-3ef9-7823-ad08-d8dcdb5a48d9`, Kierkegaard) opened the
  independent P4-W5 lineage and reported `P4W5-001` through `P4W5-007`.
- Repairs and one policy correction produced exact source
  `28f1fa7055a9194e433caea666a0c13bf2c126da`. CI `33672312445`, Release
  audit `33672312619`, and CodeQL `33672307671` passed. The same-lineage
  rereview returned `NOT_READY`, P0/P1/P2 `0/3/1`.
- Source `47aee48e248156816b863071b7df199513a7da43` added journaled
  stop-before-recovery ordering, separate daemon-restoration evidence,
  corrupt-enrolled cleanup, case-insensitive source suffix rejection, and
  removal of mutation-capable hidden smoke commands. Local Phase 4 contracts,
  all 3,211 repository tests, local macOS ARM64 native proof, artifact policy,
  and exact-head remote checks passed. CI `33675602201` became green after a
  failed-only retry of one timing-sensitive Python 3.12 test; Release audit
  `33675602206` and CodeQL `33675596478` also passed. Neither native job reran.
- The `47aee48` rereview returned `NOT_READY`, P0/P1/P2 `0/4/0`. It accepted
  D-050 as a gate-strengthening contract clarification, closed `P4W5-002`,
  `P4W5-003`, `P4W5-005`, and `P4W5-006`, and retained `P4W5-001`,
  `P4W5-004`, and `P4W5-007`. New finding `P4W5-008` showed that ignored
  working-tree files were outside the source-SHA check while PyInstaller read
  package trees directly.
- Six focused regressions reproduced the four remaining failure classes:
  launchd had no unload/resume boundary, first-run discovery enrolled unrelated
  valid candidates, an undeclared `api.token` passed below a resource tree,
  and no exact-Git source materialization existed. All six failed before the
  repair.
- The repair gives the lifecycle port explicit quiesce and resume operations.
  Launchd uses `bootout` before offline work and `bootstrap` plus `kickstart`
  afterward. The smoke shim models KeepAlive relaunch after process kill. The
  managed inventory starts empty or bootstraps only the explicit relative
  `current` candidate.
- Native builds now extract the named commit through `git archive`, digest the
  isolated source before and after PyInstaller, and put only that tree on the
  build import path. The artifact audit derives exact package-resource members
  from tracked source and rejects any extra file under those roots. Credential
  suffixes and `.env*` names are independently denied.
- The six red regressions now pass, and `make p4w5-focused` passes 108 tests.
  Candidate preflight, source freeze, full frozen-candidate verification, new
  target-native artifacts, exact-head CI, and the same-lineage rereview remain
  pending. The readiness snapshot remains unchanged and no probe was called.
- Repair candidate `e55d7488a60a98f2bf5f06cebc18f8fe485e169f` passed the
  final 108-test preflight, 112 Phase 4 tests, Ruff, MyPy on 543 files, all
  3,214 repository tests, six source-free distributions, artifact policy,
  source/artifact and reachable-history audits, Gitleaks 8.30.1 over 103
  commits, lock/workflow/diff checks, and one local macOS ARM64 build/smoke.
  Exact-head CI `33681462262`, Release audit `33681462105`, and CodeQL
  `33681457587` passed on their first attempt with all 14 PR checks green.

  `da2a5df04bc36cbcbfe20ecde4eeb9b02e5d566013c217674fa5fc2f0330af81`.
- Child 15's next same-lineage rereview returned `NOT_READY`, P0/P1/P2
  `0/2/0`. It accepted D-050 and D-051, closed `P4W5-001`, `P4W5-002`,
  `P4W5-003`, `P4W5-005`, `P4W5-006`, and `P4W5-007`, and retained only
  `P4W5-004` and `P4W5-008`. `.envrc` and `.environment` still passed in a
  runtime tree. `git archive` still accepted replacement refs and could differ
  from the raw named tree through attribute rules.
- The final focused repair rejects every case-folded component beginning with
  `.env`. Git materialization disables replacement objects, rejects replacement
  refs and repository-local attributes, neutralizes global/system attributes,
  and compares every extracted file mode and blob object ID with raw
  `git --no-replace-objects ls-tree` output. Four new cases were red before
  repair: `.envrc`, `.environment`, a replacement ref, and tracked
  `export-ignore`. The complete eight-case set and all 115 focused P4-W5 tests
  now pass. A new preflight, source freeze, frozen-candidate gates, native
  artifacts, exact-head checks, and same-lineage verdict remain pending.

## P4-W5 accepted source and artifact closure

- The accepted source candidate is
  `c7c4fad1b109ac7d7c55d55cdfa57b64a9c910db`. Its one candidate preflight
  passed 115 focused tests, pinned Python 3.12 validation, actionlint, manifest
  validation, Ruff, MyPy on 21 touched files, and diff integrity.
- The frozen local ladder passed 119 Phase 4/security tests, Ruff, MyPy on 543
  files, all 3,221 repository tests, six source-free distributions, artifact
  policy, source/artifact and reachable-history audits, Gitleaks 8.30.1 over
  104 commits, lock/workflow/diff checks, and a clean worktree.
- The separate local macOS ARM64 build materialized and verified source-tree
  digest `2befe27e25b7feaf67e3efea8dea95d15c888f194c087903eb43488bc25e1c7f`.
  Its 142-member, four-symlink artifact has membership

- Every local and CI native runtime result passed: activation, KeepAlive-aware
  quiescence, owner-confirmed corrupt rollback and daemon restoration, a second
  active-daemon upgrade, public-control Portable export/import, backup/restore,
  connector isolation, uninstall, clean residue, and no source checkout or
  system Python.
- Child 15's final same-lineage review returned `READY`, P0/P1/P2 `0/0/0`,
  against the exact source and all three artifact subjects. It accepted D-050
  and D-051, explicitly closed `P4W5-001` through `P4W5-008`, and opened no
  finding. The lineage is closed.
- The immutable readiness snapshot remains byte-for-byte unchanged at SHA-256
  `753a1635aa2be81f3ebe6b3723dbc8e46a6d6aa46f1b39003b9d9c39da769d1b`.
  No readiness probe reran. Its Linux false result remains the recorded
  `ubuntu-latest` versus required `ubuntu-24.04` mismatch; the exact target job
  above supplies P4-W5 acceptance without rewriting that one-shot evidence.
- P4-W5 is complete. D-031 and D-048 bind acceptance to source `c7c4fad` and
  the artifact/member digests above. This evidence closure changes only the
  workstream evidence documents and does not alter accepted source, tests,
  policy, workflows, or artifacts.
- P4-W6 has not started. Notarization readiness remains false and blocks its
  signed/notarized candidate gate. Recovery readiness also remains false and
  blocks the later recovery/rehearsal gates. No signing, notarization,
  publication, tag, release, deployment, production/private-state mutation,
  recovery action, or cutover occurred.

## P4-W6 implementation candidate

- The owner completed the private credential remediation outside public state. A bounded local
  check confirms exactly one usable Developer ID Application identity, and the native-build
  environment can resolve the required CPython and PyInstaller license files. No account, team,
  certificate subject, profile selector, password, or raw notary output entered the repository or
  public evidence.
- D-052 separates release assembly from the accepted P4-W5 path. P4-W5 defaults remain
  `candidate_native-p4w5` and `P4-W5`. No P4-W5 build, smoke target, readiness probe, publication,
  tag, release, deployment, production access, or cutover ran during this implementation pass.
- Red-first P4-W6 contracts initially failed because the release modules and CI/Make targets did
  not exist. The implemented layer signs nested macOS code inside-out with hardened runtime and
  secure timestamps, creates and signs a DMG, requires accepted zero-issue notarization, staples
  and assesses the DMG, and packages Linux as a deterministic checksummed tarball.
- The artifact-only clean-host harness covers install, prior-schema migration, supervised daemon
  health, exact backup/restore bytes, V0-GATE-07, V0-GATE-13, Portable round trip, forced rollback,
  successful upgrade, uninstall, and residue with no source checkout or system Python. A
  disposable rehearsal using already accepted P4-W5 native bytes and only P4-W6 packaging/test
  surfaces passed the complete harness on macOS in about 20 seconds; it did not rebuild or mutate
  P4-W5 evidence.
- The final assembler closes 23 exact coordinates, emits bounded macOS 14 unavailable-runner
  evidence alongside a separate source-equivalent result, writes SPDX 2.3 and license evidence,
  rejects untracked output residue, and revalidates all hashes, checksums, native-build evidence,
  notarization evidence, clean-host records, supported hosts, Portable range, and unpublished
  publication state.
- Initial source candidate `b99e6194d6e4f28cf7b3294b6cd1c63ef734fbac` exposed one bounded
  exact-build failure after all three Python distributions built: `uv build --out-dir` creates an
  exact one-byte `*` `.gitignore` beside its outputs. The inventory continued to reject all
  residue; assembly now removes only that exact generated marker and has a focused fail-closed
  regression for any differing bytes.
- Corrected source `69a9596031d96dfd51f9db3464f13c893709373c` built all six exact Python
  artifacts. Its macOS submission was accepted by Apple, but the bounded parser stopped before
  stapling because a zero-issue notary log represented `issues` as JSON `null` instead of `[]`.
  The parser now accepts only those two zero-issue representations; null, empty-list, nonempty,
  and invalid-shape behavior is covered without recording the submission ID or raw output.
- Source `3439fe68e402be26a87f3774df103c2acfbc2601` built all six exact Python
  artifacts and a Developer ID-signed macOS ARM64 DMG. Apple accepted it with zero issues; the
  ticket stapled and validated, Gatekeeper assessment passed, and the exact DMG passed the complete
  artifact-only lifecycle in 19 seconds. Its SHA-256 was
  `be0a845f2f25c70ae3df0f08e9e949d84ce2e87a0ebffa5e7ab18789b7002fda`.
- That candidate is superseded rather than promoted: the local Make invocation echoed its absolute
  input paths before the bounded harness result. The recipe is now silent and a static contract
  prevents path-bearing command echo. Exact source binding requires fresh artifacts after this
  source-only hygiene repair.
- Source `dda22d761f2019b3ccff82462d72203e25a39851` produced fresh exact Python artifacts
  and a signed, accepted, stapled, validated DMG at SHA-256
  `294698fdfcb029cd97e7d34e75ced47d3792ce8ed45c1c4f21e96b9778321c03`; its path-silent
  macOS lifecycle passed. Exact-head Release audit `33713364009`, Linux native build, Python
  artifact build, and the source-equivalent macOS 14 build/lifecycle passed.
- CI run `33713363991` then reproduced one Linux-only harness defect on all three hosts: GNU
  `cp -R` preserved the managed `current` symlink where macOS `ditto` copied its target. The
  controller now validates and copies the explicit enrolled candidate directory. The downloaded
  exact Linux archive passed the corrected full lifecycle inside a local Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64
  container. Fresh exact-head CI remains required; no failed-only job was rerun.
- Source `25a785a3bee982e136e3fd5189ffd87057ac5a4b` advanced all three exact-head Linux
  jobs past artifact installation, then failed inside the broad prior-schema stage. Exact-head CI
  `33713739975` still passed the Python and Linux builds, macOS 14 source-equivalent lifecycle,
  Phase 4 contracts, and broad Python matrix; Release audit `33713739976` passed.
- Diagnostic source `5e2bbb25da8673803f4abdd8b3c4b8d3bfc0473f` split that stage into bounded
  operations. CI `33714301547` reproduced `prior-schema-init` on Ubuntu 24.04, Ubuntu 26.04, and
  Debian 13. A local Linux reproduction with the fixture tree forced to host-runner UID 1001
  failed at the same operation: GNU `cp -p` preserved that foreign owner inside the root
  container, and the product correctly rejected its owner-only initialization files.
- The fixture copy now uses `cp -RP` into a newly created private destination. This preserves
  bytes, modes, and symlinks while making the lifecycle user the owner. The synthetic foreign-owner
  regression passes the complete artifact-only lifecycle on Ubuntu 24.04 and Debian 13. Local
  Ubuntu 26.04 QEMU extraction is unavailable because its tar/filesystem combination returns
  `Function not implemented`; native exact-head CI remains the acceptance subject for that host.
- Current pre-commit gates pass: `make p4w6-preflight` with 28 focused tests and pinned native
  configuration; the 10-test release-policy suite; `make phase4-contracts` with 147 tests, Ruff,
  strict MyPy on 549 files, and manifest validation; and `make verify` with all 3,249 repository
  tests plus all six source-free distribution builds and artifact policy. Actionlint, ShellCheck,
  Perl syntax, diff integrity, and the immutable readiness hash also pass.
- The immutable snapshot remains exactly
  `753a1635aa2be81f3ebe6b3723dbc8e46a6d6aa46f1b39003b9d9c39da769d1b`. Exact-source native media,
  notarization, the CI host matrix, final manifest, exact-head audits, and independent review remain
  pending until this source candidate is committed.

## P4-W6 accepted source and unpublished candidate closure

- The accepted source is `537bc4f1059ef4b4e8f0916702f38f4e531b13fe`. Its exact-head CI
  `33714932363`, Release audit `33714932452`, and CodeQL `33714929770` passed on attempt one. PR
  #6 reports all 20 checks green, including all three Linux clean-host jobs, the macOS 14
  source-equivalent lifecycle, Python/native builds, Phase 4 contracts, and Python 3.12 through
  3.14 verification.
- Final local gates passed 28 focused P4-W6 tests, 147 Phase 4/security tests, Ruff, strict MyPy on
  549 files, all 3,249 repository tests, six source-free Python builds, artifact policy, the
  source-plus-six-artifact release audit, reachable-history audit, and Gitleaks 8.30.1 over 112
  commits. Local HEAD, remote HEAD, and the clean worktree matched the accepted source.

  `26ea9d2c5f26eda35e4957255227a8b6470ee6bbf69403df5b58c32a7d30f169`, and the same exact
  source-tree digest as Linux.
- Fifty-four nested code subjects were signed inside-out with hardened runtime and secure
  timestamps. Apple accepted the submission with zero issues; opaque receipt
  `rct_v1_bac00e280d273df7c2fc0aa9293f6039ec46203215e08d87e6e2e7f07447fbf5` is stapled and
  validated, Gatekeeper assessment passed, and no account, team, certificate, profile, submission
  ID, or raw notary output entered public evidence.
- Ubuntu 24.04, Ubuntu 26.04, and Debian 13 passed the exact Linux lifecycle with two-second setup
  receipts. The macOS 14 source-equivalent artifact passed in two seconds. The exact signed DMG
  passed on macOS 26 in four seconds, while the separate macOS 14 record carries only the
  plan-authorized `exact-signed-candidate-runner-unavailable` blocker.
- The release candidate contains exactly 23 coordinates. Its standalone verifier rechecked every
  artifact hash, checksum, build receipt, host role, Portable schema range, SPDX 2.3 document,
  license binding, and the empty tag/package/release sets with publication status `unpublished`.
- An exploratory audit over-scoped the text scanner to the native tar and produced the expected
  size-limit findings; a following command initially masked that exit status. The final gate used
  fail-fast shell behavior and the intended source-plus-six-Python-artifact scope, while dedicated
  native and release-candidate validators covered binary media.
- Child 17 (`01a0658a-9e01-71f3-98fa-6753cacc2c4e`) returned no verdict before two 60-second
  waits triggered the timeout breaker. Fresh child 18 (`01a0658f-0169-7d41-8084-093c4f90d7f7`)
  initially returned `NOT_READY`, P0/P1/P2 `0/1/0`, only because a coordinator interruption left
  four review checks unfinished. Its bounded same-lineage rereview independently completed those
  checks, closed `P4W6-AR-001`, and returned `READY`, P0/P1/P2 `0/0/0`, with no finding.
- P4-W5 remains unchanged at accepted source
  `c7c4fad1b109ac7d7c55d55cdfa57b64a9c910db`. The readiness snapshot remains byte-for-byte
  unchanged at SHA-256
  `753a1635aa2be81f3ebe6b3723dbc8e46a6d6aa46f1b39003b9d9c39da769d1b`; no readiness probe
  or P4-W5 target reran. P4-W6 is complete. P4-W7 is unstarted, and no publication, tag,
  release, deployment, production/private-content access, or cutover occurred.
